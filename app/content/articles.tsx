          ‚Äúcloud‚Äù in the sky, it&apos;s actually the opposite ‚Äî it&apos;s
          powered within the depths of the oceans. Complex hardware underlies
          all software, and global networking is no exception. The internet
          relies on submarine fiber-optic cables on the seafloor that form an
          interconnected highway system for data.

      "It's nearly impossible to go a day without interacting with someone ‚Äî a roommate, professor, barista, stranger on the train, or creator on the internet. Our lives are woven together through countless small moments, reminders that we aren't just individuals, but parts of a larger whole. These parts are not necessarily symmetrical, and that's the beauty of harmony.",
      "Science mirrors this principle, and no single discipline holds all the answers. A biologist, a chemist, and a physicist will each define ‚Äúlife‚Äù differently, but their combined perspectives create a more comprehensive understanding of the world. Some of the most groundbreaking discoveries emerge from this intellectual harmony, forging new fields like physical chemistry and astrobiology.",
      "Just as science thrives on collaboration, so does society. When one group suffers, the effects ripple outward. We see this in our interconnected economy, our political alliances, and our individual capacity for empathy. In times of uncertainty, division can feel inevitable ‚Äî but progress depends on recognizing what unites us. Lasting solutions will emerge not from opposition but from collaboration, where we listen, find common ground, and build something greater together. In difficult times, returning to shared truths can help steady ourselves. Science is no exception. Communicating science clearly, honestly, and thoughtfully is not just an academic exercise; it's a way to remain grounded, build bridges, and ensure that knowledge continues to benefit everyone.",
      "This issue explores harmony in its many forms. We investigate gravitational waves and extraterrestrial life. We explore the intersection of science and politics amidst a new U.S. administration. We dive into musical harmony, uncovering how the brain interprets music from rock anthems to classic pop earworms. We also examine new bioengineering methods, from engineered blood vessels to 3D-printed organs. And, we look to nature, studying harmony within animal communities and the broader relationship between climate change and our natural world.",
      "For my final issue as editor-in-chief, I want to thank our writers, editors, designers, and photographers for bringing this magazine to life. I am also deeply grateful to our e-board, outreach, social media, and web teams ‚Äî the supportive threads holding this magazine together. NU Sci has been a home for me, a space where collaboration and curiosity flourish. I hope this issue reflects the beautiful harmony within the scientific community at Northeastern and beyond.",

      "I love solving jigsaw puzzles, but I have one golden rule ‚Äî I can't look at the picture on the box. My friends tease me for taking the longer path, but to me, it's more satisfying to navigate on my own, testing pieces (and making mistakes) until they eventually fit. This way, you can't see the result from the beginning. Instead, you work piece by piece until you finally see the bigger picture.",

      "Take black holes, for example. Scientists have had evidence of their existence for over a century, but capturing an image of one seemed impossible. Black holes swallow light, making them invisible. But researchers persevered, developing the Event Horizon Telescope to aggregate data from observatories worldwide. Finally, in 2019, they revealed the first-ever image of a black hole, turning a long-standing enigma into a groundbreaking discovery. And still, we've only scratched the surface of black holes and their secrets, giving us new avenues for further research.",
      "This issue of NU Sci uncovers enigmas all around us. We ask if sibling birth order impacts personality, and examine discoveries relating to gut health and molecular aging. We look at cultural phenomena like parasocialism and nepotism alongside neurological processes like memory sorting. We investigate whether or not animals have morals, explore possible treatments for ALS, and even discuss the potential existence of a new planet.",
      "Thank you to our writers, editors, designers, and photographers for contributing their creativity and passion. I also thank our e-board members and the software, social media, and outreach teams working hard to make this possible.

My friends and I joke about this digital limbo, a place of emptiness floating beyond the bounds of retrieval in some eerie, unreachable dimension.",
      "The void represents something lost, missing or simply unknown. Once in the void, what is gone often cannot be retrieved. Yet this loss, paradoxically, offers a fresh start. In this sense, the void can be an opportunity for growth and may not be as bleak as it seems at first glance.",
      "Acknowledging the voids around us, whether personal or societal, can help us bridge knowledge gaps and reach mutual understanding with each other. In science, identifying voids in our knowledge drives innovation and unearths solutions to our pressing issues. In the American political climate, many feel a void in representation and policy that leaves them dissatisfied. Personal voids exist too ‚Äî for me, the impending thought of graduation and losing the familiar bubble of my college environment is scary, but it also represents a fresh start: a new life chapter with a stronger sense of independence. Pinpointing precisely what's missing is essential for making meaningful progress and lasting solutions.",

We reflect on the impact of technology on art and human empathy, alongside philosophical questions of consciousness and the block universe theory. Finally, we delve into nature's mysteries, from the depths of the Mariana Trench to the phenomenon of disappearing stars.",

      "In a quiet, sterile Japanese laboratory in 1987, Yoshizumi Ishino and his team discovered a strange genetic sequencing result that would forever change biology. A sequence of palindromic nucleotides repeated itself, like a section of DNA mistakenly copy-pasted too many times. Intrigued, yet unable to explain this, they quickly documented the anomaly and moved on.",
      "These repeats, later coined 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats' (CRISPR), reveal a clever bacterial immune system that defends against viruses by cutting up their genetic information. In recent decades, CRISPR has been harnessed by humans to enhance crops, alter harmful species through gene drives, and even edit human genes to treat conditions like sickle cell disease. More uses have been envisioned, but ethical debates continue over CRISPR's potential consequences.",
      "Cascades are all around us. Stumbling upon this inherently simple DNA sequence triggered a cascade in biology and beyond, reminding us how even the smallest discoveries can have far-reaching consequences. Other cascades are more deliberate, like grassroots political movements hoping to inspire change, or big technology companies hoping to dominate by developing new AI-powered features. All cascades, whether unintentional or engineered, illustrate the profound cause-and-effect dynamics that shape our world and remind us to thoroughly consider the implications of advancements before proceeding.",
