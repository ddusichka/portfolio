            My friends and I love going to concerts, and I wanted to make a more
            fun way to decide which ones we should go to. I also wanted to build
            my first app with separate well-designed front-end and back-end. I
            decided to challenge myself with this app by using MongoDB and
            Express for the first time.

            functionality for individual users to track what they&apos;re

            of this app completed, there are also some things I&apos;m thinking
            of for a version 2 of this app. First, I think it would be cool to
            integrate with Spotify&apos;s API and prioritize concerts with
            artists that a user actually listens to. I also would like to dip my
            toes into the field of AI and machine learning and develop an

            I started developing Chatterbox as part of the application process
            for a software development club on campus. The only real requirement
            was to allow users to post messages in real-time across multiple
            devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first complex React project and my first time using
            Firebase and was pretty daunting at first. However, I got the hang
            of both and was able to create a message board that anyone could
            post to. As a bonus, I added bad word filtering using a library and
            incorporated user authentication via Firebase. I decided to support
            logging in with Google, email and password, and anonymous sign-in. I
            deployed this as my first Netlify website, submitted the project,
            and was accepted as a software developer!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was proud of this project and decided to keep expanding it so I
            could sharpen my React skills. I created a list of features that
            would fit in nicely, prioritized them, and got to work. The biggest
            overhaul was the addition of channels to organize messages by topic.
            I restructured the way I organized messages in Firebase and enabled
            users to create their own channels. This required the front-end to
            look different, and I decided to add a sidebar. This was pretty
            challenging with my limited CSS skills, but I was able to create a
            layout I liked! I also added user profile updating capabilities to
            the app.

            If I get a chance to revisit this project, I would love to add
            message editing and deleting. The ability to select channels to join
            and exclude others is another feature I want, along with the ability
            to create private channels. Direct messaging would also be cool.

            I also would use this app to get better at backend development.
            Currently, the front-end directly interacts with Firebase, and
            I&apos;d be interested in replacing that with a new API that handles
            these requests.

            This is a pair-programmed project implemented using the Model, View,
            Controller design paradigm. It was developed iteratively, so only a
            few features were assigned at first but the goal was to keep our
            code adaptable to future needs. We accomplished this using the
            Command design pattern.

            This was my first project involving file input and output and also

            including .jpg, .png, .bmp, and .ppm files.

            This project also began with just a command-line interface, so users

            functional but obviously not the best user experience since the user
            couldn&apos;t actually see what they were editing. The final
            iteration of this assignment was to develop a GUI using Java Swing.
            This was definitely one of the trickiest parts, but very rewarding
            since we could actually see the adjustments we were making to images
            in real-time.

          <p>
            I created this as a class project ‚Äî the goal was to get practice
            implementing a complex algorithm and creating an interactive user
            interface. This project was daunting at first but taught me a lot
            about image compression and was very satisfying to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of this project only removed seams without giving
            the user any controls. My partners and I revised it to display the
            seam being removed in red and give the user the ability to pause the
            animation. The user can also choose to remove only horizontal or
            only vertical seams by typing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;v&quot;
            respectively.

          <p>
            If I ever have a chance to revisit this project, there&apos;s a good
            amount I would change. First, the code itself is all in one large
            file that is pretty hard to understand so I&apos;d start by putting
            each class in its own file. Additionally, there&apos;s some
            redundancy ‚Äî¬†we have some pairs of functions that handle vertical
            and horizontal seams separately, but these should be abstracted into
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functionality wise, it would be cool to add the ability to add seams
            back in. I also think the ability to export a modified photo would
            be cool. Ideally, I&apos;d like to combine this functionality with
            my{" "}

            since it&apos;s a useful image manipulation technique.
