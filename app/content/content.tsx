          <p>
            I started developing Chatterbox as part of the application process
            for a software development club on campus. The only real requirement
            was to allow users to post messages in real-time across multiple
            devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first complex React project and my first time using
            Firebase and was pretty daunting at first. However, I got the hang
            of both and was able to create a message board that anyone could
            post to. As a bonus, I added bad word filtering using a library and
            incorporated user authentication via Firebase. I decided to support
            logging in with Google, email and password, and anonymous sign-in. I
            deployed this as my first Netlify website, submitted the project,
            and was accepted as a software developer!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was proud of this project and decided to keep expanding it so I
            could sharpen my React skills. I created a list of features that
            would fit in nicely, prioritized them, and got to work. The biggest
            overhaul was the addition of channels to organize messages by topic.
            I restructured the way I organized messages in Firebase and enabled
            users to create their own channels. This required the front-end to
            look different, and I decided to add a sidebar. This was pretty
            challenging with my limited CSS skills, but I was able to create a
            layout I liked! I also added user profile updating capabilities to
            the app.

            If I get a chance to revisit this project, I would love to add
            message editing and deleting. The ability to select channels to join
            and exclude others is another feature I want, along with the ability
            to create private channels. Direct messaging would also be cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also would use this app to get better at backend development.
            Currently, the front-end directly interacts with Firebase, and
            I&apos;d be interested in replacing that with a new API that handles
            these requests.

            I was inspired to make this Jeopardy app when one of my clubs,
            Biology Club, decided to host a bio-themed Jeopardy night. Having
            previously worked with Jeopardy Powerpoint templates or existing
            websites that didn&apos;t also offer buzzing and scoring, I decided
            to create my own version to meet our needs.

          <p>
            The first version of this app came after I built Chatterbox, at
            which point I felt comfortable with React and Firebase. I also
            wanted to build this quickly in time for my club to use it, so I
            stuck to familiar frameworks. However, I later revisited this
            project and wanted to build a separate backend instead of having my
            front-end directly communicate with Firebase.

            In a future version of this project, I would definitely want to
            create the concept of a game code so that multiple games can be
            played independently. Currently, questions are hard-coded and are
            biology themed. I&apos;d love to give hosts the ability to create
            their own questions or perhaps choose from a pre-determined set of
            genres. Fetching actual old Jeopardy games could be cool too.

            I created this as a class project ‚Äî the goal was to get practice

            The first version of this project only removed seams without giving

            seam being removed in red and give the user the ability to pause the
            animation. The user can also choose to remove only horizontal or

            If I ever have a chance to revisit this project, there&apos;s a good
            amount I would change. First, the code itself is all in one large
            file that is pretty hard to understand so I&apos;d start by putting
            each class in its own file. Additionally, there&apos;s some
            redundancy ‚Äî¬†we have some pairs of functions that handle vertical
            and horizontal seams separately, but these should be abstracted into
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functionality wise, it would be cool to add the ability to add seams
            back in. I also think the ability to export a modified photo would
            be cool. Ideally, I&apos;d like to combine this functionality with
            my Image Processor project since it&apos;s a useful image
            manipulation technique.

              For my first co-op experience at Northeastern, I worked at
              <b> Blueport</b>, a company that provides an omni-channel
              e-commerce platform for furniture retailers. As the only{" "}
              <b>Software Development Co-op</b> at a small company, my role had
              a lot of variety and gave me a broad range of software experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I started, Blueport had recently purchased a <b>Retool </b>
              subscription ‚Äî Retool is a low-code platform for building UIs.
              However, few apps were being built. My role was to learn how to
              use the software and begin building tools to save developer time
              and put power in the hands of retailers (our clients).
            </p>
            <p>
              Building each Retool app required... JavaScript is the language of
              Retool, so I quickly picked it up. Additionally, each app required
              the development or refinement of SQL Server procedures and/or
              tables, as well as gRPC endpoints. Thus, I gained a lot of
              <b>backend experience</b> through each app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the non-technical skills I gained include technical
              writing, presenting, and teaching. I made documentation a
              priority, so I wrote a wiki page for every tool I developed and
              also created general how-to wiki pages that I thought would be
              useful to others.
