                This app was developed for real clients as part of Generate at
                Northeastern, a student-led product development studio. I worked
                with a team of 8 other engineers, as well as a team of
                designers, to collaboratively build an initial version of this
                app.

              <p>
                The engineering team began by building the backend in Go,
                developing endpoints for user and event management. Once the
                designers created Figma mockups, we began building the front-end
                in React Native. I primarily worked on event-related
                functionality, building screens that show local events and allow
                users to react to them as shown in the screenshots above.

            I started developing Chatterbox as part of the application process
            for a software development club on campus. The only real requirement
            was to allow users to post messages in real-time across multiple
            devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first complex React project and my first time using
            Firebase and was pretty daunting at first. However, I got the hang
            of both and was able to create a message board that anyone could
            post to. As a bonus, I added bad word filtering using a library and
            incorporated user authentication via Firebase. I decided to support
            logging in with Google, email and password, and anonymous sign-in. I
            deployed this as my first Netlify website, submitted the project,
            and was accepted as a software developer!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was proud of this project and decided to keep expanding it so I
            could sharpen my React skills. I created a list of features that
            would fit in nicely, prioritized them, and got to work. The biggest
            overhaul was the addition of channels to organize messages by topic.
            I restructured the way I organized messages in Firebase and enabled
            users to create their own channels. This required the front-end to
            look different, and I decided to add a sidebar. This was pretty
            challenging with my limited CSS skills, but I was able to create a
            layout I liked! I also added user profile updating capabilities to
            the app.

            to create private channels. Direct messaging would also be cool.

            I also would use this app to get better at backend development.

            This is a pair-programmed project implemented using the Model, View,
            Controller design paradigm. It was developed iteratively, so only a
            few features were assigned at first but the goal was to keep our
            code adaptable to future needs. We accomplished this using the
            Command design pattern.

            This was my first project involving file input and output and also
            taught me a lot about image manipulation techniques. One aspect of

            including .jpg, .png, .bmp, and .ppm files.

            This project also began with just a command-line interface, so users

            functional but obviously not the best user experience since the user
            couldn&apos;t actually see what they were editing. The final
            iteration of this assignment was to develop a GUI using Java Swing.
            This was definitely one of the trickiest parts, but very rewarding
            since we could actually see the adjustments we were making to images
            in real-time.

      longDescription: `The Marble Solitaire project is an implementation of the classic board game also known as 'Peg Solitaire' 
      dating back to the 17th century. In this single-player game, the player moves marbles on a board, aiming to make valid moves to clear the board except for a single marble.\n\n
       Valid moves consist of jumping a marble orthogonally over an adjacent marble into an empty hole two positions away,
        resulting in the removal of the jumped marble.`,

            This app was developed for CS 3000: Object-Oriented Design as a solo
            project meant to illustrate the Model-View-Controller paradigm. The
            first version of this app used only one board shape (known as
            English solitaire). The game was also only playable via the command
            line where the board state was drawn out using text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future versions implemented new board shapes, including a Triangular
            and a European version. Following the MVC design pattern enabled me
            to create new models without affecting the rest of the code. Another
            addition was the graphical interface. This was developed using Java
            Swing. Just like how different classes implementing the Model
            interface were interchangeable, it was similarly easy to swap
            between Views.

            This project was meant to teach us about graphs and relevant
            algorithms. Specifically, we used the concept of a minimum spanning
            tree to create the mazes, and then solved them using breadth-first
            and depth-first search.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program launches and animates the construction of a random maze
            (Kruskal&apos;s algorithm is used to create a minimum spanning
            tree). After this, the user is able to navigate through the maze via
            arrow keys, or can watch BFS/DFS solutions via keyboard shortcuts.
            Statistics are kept to show which solution is optimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can control the shape of the generated maze, if they wish,
            by specifying if the maze should have mostly horizontal or mostly
            vertical edges. The color scheme of the board can also be changed to
            see vertices based on either their distance from the start or
            distance from the end, where red signifies being close to the
            specified point and blue represents being far.

            I created this as a class project ‚Äî the goal was to get practice
            implementing a complex algorithm and creating an interactive user
            interface. This project was daunting at first but taught me a lot
            about image compression and was very satisfying to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of this project only removed seams without giving
            the user any controls. My partners and I revised it to display the
            seam being removed in red and give the user the ability to pause the
            animation. The user can also choose to remove only horizontal or
            only vertical seams by typing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;v&quot;
            respectively.

            If I ever have a chance to revisit this project, there&apos;s a good
            amount I would change. First, the code itself is all in one large
            file that is pretty hard to understand so I&apos;d start by putting
            each class in its own file. Additionally, there&apos;s some
            redundancy ‚Äî¬†we have some pairs of functions that handle vertical
            and horizontal seams separately, but these should be abstracted into
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functionality wise, it would be cool to add the ability to add seams
            back in. I also think the ability to export a modified photo would
            be cool. Ideally, I&apos;d like to combine this functionality with
            my{" "}
