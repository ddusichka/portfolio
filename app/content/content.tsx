          <p>
            I started developing chatterbox as part of the application process
            for a software club on campus. The only requirements were to support
            real-time editing from multiple users across different devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was my first complex React project and my first time using
            Firebase and was pretty daunting at first. However, I quickly
            learned both and was able to get this functionality working. As
            bonus features, I added filtering of bad words using a library and
            incorporated user authentication via Firebase. I decided to support
            logging in with Google, email and password, and anonymous sign-in. I
            deployed this as a Netlify website (my first time doing this),
            submitted the project, and was accepted as a software developer!
          </p>
          <p>
            After getting the basic functionality down, I was proud of this
            project and decided to keep expanding it. I created a list of
            features that would fit in nicely, prioritized them, and got to
            work. Namely, I wanted to add channel-specific messaging and improve
            the front-end layout by adding a sidebar.

          <p>
            I was inspired to make this Jeopardy app when one of my clubs,
            Biology Club, decided to host a bio-themed Jeopardy night. Having
            previously worked with Jeopardy Powerpoint templates or existing
            websites that didn't also offer buzzing and scoring, I decided to
            create my own version to meet our needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of this app came after I built Chatterbox, at
            which point I felt comfortable with React and Firebase. I also
            wanted to build this quickly in time for my club to use it, so I
            stuck to familiar frameworks. However, I later revisited this
            project and wanted to build a separate backend instead of having my
            front-end directly communicate with Firebase.
