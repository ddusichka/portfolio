              two tech leads, I managed a team of 5 engineers and created
              tickets, reviewed code, and engineered features. We worked
              alongside a team of designers, helping to bring their visuals to

              The engineering team began by building the backend in Go and
              integrating with external APIs. Specifically, we integrated with
              Xero, an accounting API, and Climatiq, a carbon accounting API for
              estimating carbon emissions based on financial transactions. Once
              the design team created Figma mockups, we built the front-end
              using React, Next.js, Tailwind, and the shadcn component library.

          My friends and I love going to concerts, and I wanted to make a more
          fun way to decide which ones we should go to. I also wanted to build
          my first solo project with a separate well-designed frontend and
          backend. I{" "}

            initially built this app using Express
          </a>{" "}
          so that I could learn the framework and improve my JavaScript. I put
          it on hold during the school year, revisited it, and decided I wanted
          to redesign it and add some core functionality. First, after learning
          Express, I decided it was time to try a new framework, namely Django.
          I also wanted to use Postgres insteads of MongoDB to better take
          advantage of relationships between different entities. Lastly, I
          wanted to make the Spotify integration a priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The redevelopment of this app is still in progress (and early), but it
          currently supports event fetching via the Ticketmaster Discovery API,
          as well as Spotify authentication and library fetching. Then,
          overlapping artists within the user&apos;s library and the event
          lineup are identified. The next steps are to implement user accounts,
          a &quot;favoriting&quot; mechanism, and a more useful and aesthetic
          UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to expose myself to more concerts, especially to artists
          with only a few saved songs in my library. I think it&apos;s awesome
          to go to small concerts before artists blow up, so the goal is to find
          more of these!

          The redesign still requires a good amount of work to complete the base
          functionality. An additional nice-to-have would be the ability to
          track concerts a user actually attended, and add
          reviews/photos/setlists to serve as a digital concert scrapbook of
          sorts. It would also be cool to find ways to use AI for a new, smarter
          recommendation algorithm.

          I started developing Chatterbox as part of the application process for
          a software development club on campus. The only real requirement was
          to allow users to post messages in real-time across multiple devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first complex React project and my first time using
          Firebase and was pretty daunting at first. However, I got the hang of
          both and was able to create a message board that anyone could post to.
          As a bonus, I added bad word filtering using a library and
          incorporated user authentication via Firebase. I decided to support
          logging in with Google, email and password, and anonymous sign-in. I
          deployed this as my first Netlify website, submitted the project, and
          was accepted as a software developer!

          I was proud of this project and decided to keep expanding it so I
          could sharpen my React skills. I created a list of features that would
          fit in nicely, prioritized them, and got to work. The biggest overhaul
          was the addition of channels to organize messages by topic. I
          restructured the way I organized messages in Firebase and enabled
          users to create their own channels. This required the front-end to
          look different, and I decided to add a sidebar. This was pretty
          challenging with my limited CSS skills, but I was able to create a
          layout I liked! I also added user profile updating capabilities to the
          app.

          If I get a chance to revisit this project, I would love to add message
          editing and deleting. The ability to select channels to join and
          exclude others is another feature I want, along with the ability to
          create private channels. Direct messaging would also be cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also would use this app to get better at backend development.
          Currently, the front-end directly interacts with Firebase, and
          I&apos;d be interested in replacing that with a new API that handles
          these requests.

          In a future version of this project, I would definitely want to create
          the concept of a game code so that multiple games can be played
          independently. Currently, questions are hard-coded and are biology
          themed. I&apos;d love to give hosts the ability to create their own
          questions or perhaps choose from a pre-determined set of genres.
          Fetching actual old Jeopardy games could be cool too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also would revamp this app to use a proper backend. Currently, the
          front-end directly interacts with Firebase, and I&apos;d be interested
          in replacing that with a new API that handles these requests.

          This is a pair-programmed project implemented using the Model, View,
          Controller design paradigm. It was developed iteratively, so only a
          few features were assigned at first but the goal was to keep our code
          adaptable to future needs. We accomplished this using the Command
          design pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first project involving file input and output and also
          taught me a lot about image manipulation techniques. One aspect of the
          project was the ability to support multiple image types including
          .jpg, .png, .bmp, and .ppm files.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also began with just a command-line interface, so users
          would upload files and execute text-based editing commands. This was
          functional but obviously not the best user experience since the user
          couldn&apos;t actually see what they were editing. The final iteration
          of this assignment was to develop a GUI using Java Swing. This was
          definitely one of the trickiest parts, but very rewarding since we
          could actually see the adjustments we were making to images in
          real-time.

        super cool is image compression like what I developed in my{" "}

          This app was developed for CS 3000: Object-Oriented Design as a solo
          project meant to illustrate the Model-View-Controller paradigm. The
          first version of this app used only one board shape (known as English
          solitaire). The game was also only playable via the command line where
          the board state was drawn out using text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Future versions implemented new board shapes, including a Triangular
          and a European version. Following the MVC design pattern enabled me to
          create new models without affecting the rest of the code. Another
          addition was the graphical interface. This was developed using Java
          Swing. Just like how different classes implementing the Model
          interface were interchangeable, it was similarly easy to swap between
          Views.

          This project was meant to teach us about graphs and relevant
          algorithms. Specifically, we used the concept of a minimum spanning
          tree to create the mazes, and then solved them using breadth-first and
          depth-first search.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program launches and animates the construction of a random maze
          (Kruskal&apos;s algorithm is used to create a minimum spanning tree).
          After this, the user is able to navigate through the maze via arrow
          keys, or can watch BFS/DFS solutions via keyboard shortcuts.
          Statistics are kept to show which solution is optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can control the shape of the generated maze, if they wish, by
          specifying if the maze should have mostly horizontal or mostly
          vertical edges. The color scheme of the board can also be changed to
          see vertices based on either their distance from the start or distance
          from the end, where red signifies being close to the specified point
          and blue represents being far.

          implementing a complex algorithm and creating an interactive user

          The first version of this project only removed seams without giving

          seam being removed in red and give the user the ability to pause the
          animation. The user can also choose to remove only horizontal or only
          vertical seams by typing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;v&quot; respectively.

          If I ever have a chance to revisit this project, there&apos;s a good
          amount I would change. First, the code itself is all in one large file
          that is pretty hard to understand so I&apos;d start by putting each
          class in its own file. Additionally, there&apos;s some redundancy ‚Äî¬†we
          have some pairs of functions that handle vertical and horizontal seams
          separately, but these should be abstracted into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functionality wise, it would be cool to add the ability to add seams
          back in. I also think the ability to export a modified photo would be
          cool. Ideally, I&apos;d like to combine this functionality with my{" "}
